# Documentation
===

Final report and necessary documentation for the code used in our semester project. Final report is in the format of a Jupyter Notebook with inline analysis on the dataset and markdown cells for the body of the report.

**Note:** Due to the protected nature of our dataset, it is **not** included in this repository. Therefore, if the Jupyter Notebook is rerun, it will throw an error in the inline analysis because it cannt find the file that it is looking for. The PDF and HTML files are intended for users to look through the code and read the report.
