# CMSE491 - Computational Biology and Bioinformatics - Semester Project

## Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Microbiome Data.

#### Authors:  
 
**Nathaniel Hawkins.** *Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University. East Lansing, MI. 48823.*

**Brian Nohomovich.** *College of Osteopathic Medicine and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. East Lansing, MI. 48912.*

#### Summary of Repository and Directory Structure:  
 
* `doc` - Holds final project report in the form of a Jupyter Notebook with the analysis pipeline inlined and the writeup in markdown cells. Report will also be in the form of PDF and HTML.

* `src` - Location of all of our source code used in our analysis. If the dataset were accessible, then one would have to run `sh runlog.sh` and the analysis pipeline would be run and all appropriate results directed to the proper output directories.

* `results` - Location where our figures live. If the dataset were accessible, this is where the log file would go as well when conducting the final analysis.

#### Statement About the Dataset:

The dataset is under IRB-protection and is currently under control by Dr. Shannon Manning. Requests for access to the database need to be made to her. The dataset can be accessed on select computers in her lab. Contact Brain Nohomovich for inquiry: `nohomovi@msu.edu`

#### Author Contributions:   

+ Nathaniel Hawkins: Writing the code and developing computational methods. Writing up descriptions of methods used in the project. 

+ Brian Nohomovich: Developing the computational methods and writing code. Working with the dataset and ensuring that was useable in the pipeline (data wrangling). Writing of biological background and context to the study.

Reponsibility of writing the final report and slides was shared between the two of us equally. In terms of hours contributed, this project was balanced. Work was conducted together, but with one of us taking point on areas we were more comfortable with.
